## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `quorum doctor`: one pass over everything that fails soft — config (the one
  strict parse), `[harness.*]` binaries and argv templates, git, projects, gh
  auth, herdr, nono, prompt staleness, supervisor lock and version, orphaned
  `runner.lock`s, stale inbox claims, agent failure streaks. One line per
  check (✓ / ✗ / –, only ✗ exits non-zero), `--json` for scripts, and an
  opt-in `--smoke [HARNESS]` that runs your harness for real through the
  runner's own code — in a scratch directory *and* a scratch `QUORUM_HOME`,
  killing the whole process tree on timeout. Diagnoses only; never repairs.
  (#24)
- First-class perpetual tasks: `quorum task add --perpetual` marks work that
  is not meant to finish. The preamble's `{perpetual}` block (new packaged
  `task-perpetual.md`, appended even on homes with an edited preamble)
  softens delivery to commit+push per cycle; the digest renders
  `perpetual=true`, withholds `possible-loop`, and flags `PERPETUAL-ENDED`
  when such a task reports a terminal status; the manager prompt relaunches
  it forever and never cancels it; status/TUI/web badge it `∞`. (#12, #36)
- Agent-run usage ledger: manager and prompt-agent harness runs append
  `{at, run, usage}` to `state/manager/usage.jsonl` /
  `state/agents/<name>/usage.jsonl`; surfaced on agent rows and as the
  digest's opening self-cost line. (#32, #36)
- Optional auto-commit safety net: with `[tasks].auto_commit = true` a dirty
  worktree is committed to the task branch after the harness exits — never
  pushed, never sets status, refuses detached-HEAD / mid-merge trees, skipped
  under the nono sandbox, recorded on the run and in the transcript. (#13, #25)
- `possible-loop` digest flag: a repetition read over a live run's tool calls,
  an observation for the manager to judge, thresholds tuned to prefer false
  negatives. (#18, #28)
- Token/cost usage captured from harness result events (claude `result`, codex
  `turn.completed`/`token_count`) onto each `TaskRun`, fail-soft (`null` when a
  harness reports nothing), surfaced in `quorum status`, the TUI, the web
  dashboard and the manager digest. `[tasks].max_cost_per_run` /
  `max_tokens_per_run` flag an over-budget run (`BUDGET-EXCEEDED`) without
  enforcing anything. (#19 capture half, #29)
- Fail-soft CI probe: `ci.py` runs `gh pr view` inside a task's workdir and
  adds a `ci:` line (state, checks, failing check names, merge conflict) to
  the digest, with `CI-FAILING` on a finished task over red checks; every
  disappointment degrades to no line. Optional `[ci]` table. (#17, #30)
- Shipped `babysitter` prompt agent: a whole CI-reactive policy written as
  prompt text, started with `quorum agent create babysitter --schedule "every 10m"`. (#17, #30)
- Positioning pass across README and docs: cross-harness, local-first,
  policy-owned supervision and session adoption claimed explicitly. (#22, #26)

### Fixed
- `[ci].enabled = false` (and `[herdr]`) inside a malformed `config.toml`
  was silently ignored — the probes fell back to enabled. An unreadable
  config now disables them; a missing one still auto-detects; neither can
  raise into the manager tick. The four private load-config fallbacks in
  cli/views/manager/ci became `config.try_load_config` /
  `load_config_or_default`. (#33, #34, #36)
- Harnesses with `inject = "stream-json"` receive the prompt as the opening
  stdin turn instead of an ignored argv argument — previously every such run
  hung until timeout. (#24)
- A successful tick clears stale failure fields on the agent heartbeat, so a
  recovered agent no longer reports its last error forever. (#27)
- Codex usage fallback no longer double-counts `cached_input_tokens` (a
  subset of `input_tokens`, unlike claude's disjoint fields); malformed usage
  data on disk degrades to silence instead of raising out of status/web. (#29)
- The CI probe's fail-soft contract now covers every exception (a non-UTF-8
  `gh` output could previously crash the manager tick), and the per-digest
  probe budget is spent only on tasks that can actually be probed. (#30)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-29

First tagged release. Bring-your-own-harness orchestration for long-running
coding tasks: projects, plain-English tasks executed as harness runs in
per-task git worktrees, a harness-driven manager whose policy lives in
`prompts/manager.md`, a file-based board + maildir inboxes as the only
transports, live-session adoption for claude-code / codex / opencode, TUI and
web dashboards as pure readers, optional nono sandboxing, and a herdr doorbell.
