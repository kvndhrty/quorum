## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Hung-session restart** (#42). A harness session that hangs — blocked on
  stdin, waiting on a turn that never returns — used to cost a whole
  supervision cycle at best and a whole night at worst, because the only kill
  was `task cancel --kill`, which ends the task too.
  - `quorum task stop <id>` ends the *run* and nothing else: SIGTERM (then
    SIGKILL) to the runner's process group, so the harness and everything it
    spawned go with it, while the task keeps its status, its queue position
    and its worktree. The interrupted run is recorded (`stopped`, its
    `fresh_session` kind, a `run.stopped` transcript note, the stale lock
    cleared) rather than left looking live — including for a runner that was
    already dead when the stop looked, which gets the same tidying without a
    signal. Attached tasks are refused — quorum never kills your own
    interactive session.
  - `quorum task run <id> --fresh-session` forgets the stored session id and
    starts a new session in the same worktree, for when *resuming* is what
    keeps failing. Recorded as `fresh_session` on the run — by the runner,
    and by `task stop` for a fresh run it killed, so the manager's
    "escalate after two fresh restarts" can actually count them.
  - `[tasks].run_stall_timeout_seconds` (0 = off, the default) is a runner
    watchdog: no harness output for that long ends the run, marks it
    `stalled`, and turns a hang into an ordinary dead runner. It counts
    silence, not progress — set it above your longest quiet step.
  - The manager digest gains a `STALLED` observation (a live runner whose
    transcript has not grown for 30 minutes — or, for a run that hung before
    printing anything at all, one that started that long ago) plus `stopped=` /
    `fresh_sessions=` / `last-run=stalled` marks, and `prompts/manager.md`
    gains the policy that reads them: look at the tail once, stop and
    resume, then restart with a fresh session and a summarizing nudge, then
    escalate after two fresh restarts. Observations, never rails — quorum
    still ends no run on its own judgement.

### Changed

- **A zombie process no longer counts as a live run.** An exited process its
  parent has not reaped is still a process-table entry, so `kill(pid, 0)`
  and `killpg(pgid, 0)` both answered "alive" for one — which made
  `quorum task stop` report a run that survived SIGKILL and left the next
  `task run` refusing to start. `runner.launch_detached` now reaps its child
  from a daemon thread (a caller that keeps running, such as the TUI's `s`
  binding, no longer leaves one behind), and `fsio.pid_alive` /
  `fsio.group_alive` confirm a live-looking pid or group against the process
  state `ps` reports, so a corpse reads as dead. Fail-soft: where `ps`
  cannot answer, the old reading stands.
- `prompts/manager.md` — new hung-session section (item 7) and two new tools
  in its command list. An unedited copy is upgraded by `quorum init`; an
  edited one is not, so move house rules into `prompts/manager.local.md`
  (`quorum prompt diff manager` shows the gap).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-01

### Upgrading from 0.1.0

After installing the new version, in each `QUORUM_HOME`:

1. `quorum init` — refreshes every prompt you never edited to the new
   packaged default (recognized by hash) and seeds the new
   `task-perpetual.md` and `babysitter.md`. Config is left untouched.
2. If you edited `prompts/manager.md`, move your house rules into
   `prompts/manager.local.md` and delete the edited copy, then run
   `quorum init` again — an edited template is never upgraded, so it would
   otherwise miss every 0.2.0 policy change (`quorum prompt diff manager`
   shows the gap).
3. `quorum down && quorum up` — the manager tick runs inside the supervisor
   process, which keeps the old code until restarted. Detached task runs
   are unaffected.
4. `quorum doctor` — confirms the result.

### Added
- `quorum doctor`: one pass over everything that fails soft — config (the one
  strict parse), `[harness.*]` binaries and argv templates, git, projects, gh
  auth, herdr, nono, prompt staleness, supervisor lock and version, orphaned
  `runner.lock`s, stale inbox claims, agent failure streaks. One line per
  check (✓ / ✗ / –, only ✗ exits non-zero), `--json` for scripts, and an
  opt-in `--smoke [HARNESS]` that runs your harness for real through the
  runner's own code — in a scratch directory *and* a scratch `QUORUM_HOME`,
  killing the whole process tree on timeout. Diagnoses only; never repairs.
  (#39, #49)
- Task dependencies: `quorum task add --after <id>...` queues a task that
  waits on others. The runner refuses to start it while any upstream is
  still unfinished (`⏳` in status/TUI/web, `waiting-on=` in the digest, and
  the manager prompt tells it never to launch one); an upstream that ended
  `blocked`/`cancelled` or was pruned no longer blocks — it is surfaced as
  `DEP-FAILED` / `DEP-MISSING` for the manager to judge. A perpetual task
  can never be an upstream. (#31, #45)
- Prompt overlays: `prompts/<name>.local.md` is merged into the packaged
  template at a `{local}` slot (manager, task preamble, perpetual block), so
  house policy lives beside the default instead of forking it, and
  `quorum init` keeps upgrading the unedited template. An unreadable overlay
  renders as no overlay rather than failing every tick; `quorum prompt
  list|diff` show overlays and degrade per file. (#37, #46)
- Manager notebook: `quorum manager remember|notes|forget` is a standing
  memory separate from the scrolling action journal — `notes.jsonl` per
  agent, optional `--ttl`, rendered in its own bounded slot at the top of
  every digest (with a line for what was dropped or not scanned). Only the
  owner or the user may write to it (a convention, not a security boundary);
  malformed lines are skipped, never crash a tick. Both dashboards show an
  agent's notebook. (#35, #47)
- TUI write affordances beyond the nudge: `m` sends the manager a directive
  (`quorum manager tell`), `s` starts a detached run (refused on an attached
  task or a live runner), `c` cancels a task behind a yes/no confirmation.
  All four act on the *highlighted* row while the task table has focus —
  `enter` opens a transcript, it does not arm the write keys — and all four
  report an unwritable home as a notification rather than crashing the
  dashboard. (#11, #44)
- Sustained-failure escalation for agents exempt from auto-pause: after
  `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` the supervisor posts one `agent.failing` to
  `attention` (the banner `quorum status`, the TUI and the web header read) —
  the only failure path that reaches `attention`; auto-pause, tick errors and
  the closing `agent.recovered` all stay on `system`. Deduped by an
  `escalated_at` heartbeat stamp written after the post lands, and cleared by
  every success path (scheduled tick, `agent run-once`, `agent resume`). (#38)
- First-class perpetual tasks: `quorum task add --perpetual` marks work that
  is not meant to finish. The preamble's `{perpetual}` block (new packaged
  `task-perpetual.md`, appended even on homes with an edited preamble)
  softens delivery to commit+push per cycle; the digest renders
  `perpetual=true`, withholds `possible-loop`, and flags `PERPETUAL-ENDED`
  when such a task reports a terminal status; the manager prompt relaunches
  it forever and never cancels it; status/TUI/web badge it `∞`. (#12, #36)
- Agent-run usage ledger: manager and prompt-agent harness runs append
  `{at, run, usage}` to `state/manager/usage.jsonl` /
  `state/agents/<name>/usage.jsonl`; surfaced on agent rows and as the
  digest's opening self-cost line. (#32, #36)
- Optional auto-commit safety net: with `[tasks].auto_commit = true` a dirty
  worktree is committed to the task branch after the harness exits — never
  pushed, never sets status, refuses detached-HEAD / mid-merge trees, skipped
  under the nono sandbox, recorded on the run and in the transcript. (#13, #25)
- `possible-loop` digest flag: a repetition read over a live run's tool calls,
  an observation for the manager to judge, thresholds tuned to prefer false
  negatives. (#18, #28)
- Token/cost usage captured from harness result events (claude `result`, codex
  `turn.completed`/`token_count`) onto each `TaskRun`, fail-soft (`null` when a
  harness reports nothing), surfaced in `quorum status`, the TUI, the web
  dashboard and the manager digest. `[tasks].max_cost_per_run` /
  `max_tokens_per_run` flag an over-budget run (`BUDGET-EXCEEDED`) without
  enforcing anything. (#19 capture half, #29)
- Fail-soft CI probe: `ci.py` runs `gh pr view` inside a task's workdir and
  adds a `ci:` line (state, checks, failing check names, merge conflict) to
  the digest, with `CI-FAILING` on a finished task over red checks; every
  disappointment degrades to no line. Optional `[ci]` table. (#17, #30)
- Shipped `babysitter` prompt agent: a whole CI-reactive policy written as
  prompt text, started with `quorum agent create babysitter --schedule "every 10m"`. (#17, #30)
- Positioning pass across README and docs: cross-harness, local-first,
  policy-owned supervision and session adoption claimed explicitly. (#22, #26)

### Fixed
- `[ci].enabled = false` (and `[herdr]`) inside a malformed `config.toml`
  was silently ignored — the probes fell back to enabled. An unreadable
  config now disables them; a missing one still auto-detects; neither can
  raise into the manager tick. The four private load-config fallbacks in
  cli/views/manager/ci became `config.try_load_config` /
  `load_config_or_default`. (#33, #34, #36)
- Harnesses with `inject = "stream-json"` receive the prompt as the opening
  stdin turn instead of an ignored argv argument — previously every such run
  hung until timeout. (#24)
- A successful tick clears stale failure fields on the agent heartbeat, so a
  recovered agent no longer reports its last error forever. (#27)
- Codex usage fallback no longer double-counts `cached_input_tokens` (a
  subset of `input_tokens`, unlike claude's disjoint fields); malformed usage
  data on disk degrades to silence instead of raising out of status/web. (#29)
- The CI probe's fail-soft contract now covers every exception (a non-UTF-8
  `gh` output could previously crash the manager tick), and the per-digest
  probe budget is spent only on tasks that can actually be probed. (#30)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-29

First tagged release. Bring-your-own-harness orchestration for long-running
coding tasks: projects, plain-English tasks executed as harness runs in
per-task git worktrees, a harness-driven manager whose policy lives in
`prompts/manager.md`, a file-based board + maildir inboxes as the only
transports, live-session adoption for claude-code / codex / opencode, TUI and
web dashboards as pure readers, optional nono sandboxing, and a herdr doorbell.
